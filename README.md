Historian-WARC-Toolkit
======================

The Historian's WARC Toolkit

I am just going to be tinkering here. It will create a workflow that brings together wget, WARC Tools, MALLET,
and various visualization tools introduced in _Programming Historian 2_ [http://programminghistorian.org].

If you have any suggestions, comments, etc., please do not hesitate to fork or e-mail.
