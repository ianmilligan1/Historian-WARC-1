Historian-WARC-1
======================

I am just going to be tinkering here. It will create a workflow that brings together wget, WARC Tools, MALLET,
and various visualization tools introduced in _Programming Historian 2_ [http://programminghistorian.org].

If you have any suggestions, comments, etc., please do not hesitate to fork or e-mail. I normally program in <em>Mathematica</em> 
so my Python is a bit rusty. And this is the first time I have scripted in bash.

At some point, I will need to port this to Bash. But proof of concept first. :)
